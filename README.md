Extending protein search for many proteins vs. many other proteins. Visualized with a hypergraph.

## TODO

- [ ] Experiment
     - [ ] Use foldseek in python
     - [ ] Use foldseek on many proteins in python
     - [ ] Visualize a graph of the proteins
     - [ ] Go deeper into the graph n nodes
     - [ ] Visualize hypergraph somehow
     - [ ] See if I can extract insights from the extracted graph or chat with it
- [ ] Come up with more todos
